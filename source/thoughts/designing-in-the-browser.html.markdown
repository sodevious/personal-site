I’m just going to take a break from my stats project and leave a little note. As web designers, we all have preferences in the way that we do things. I for one, love designing in the browser. It’s a valuable tool that takes time and guesswork out of web design.

Usually, I do start away from the browser. I like to sketch with paper, or do a quick photoshop wireframe with colors and a basic layout. Sometimes I even take that further and make a fuller mockup. Even when doing that, I find it difficult to really pinpoint details. Photoshop is a machine of unlimited power, however the web is not. I think that by being limited during production, the final product is more solid.

With CSS3 comes the power to be more flexible, and I embrace that. I only use images whenever I have to, because I love how code can just translate so beautifully on the web.
